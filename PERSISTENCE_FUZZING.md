# Persistence validation and fuzzing

## Status and prerequisites

These commands are test-only. They require a **complete checkout**, its real PWA images/audio/maps, Node **24 or later**, the installed locked dependencies, and installed Playwright browser binaries. The stripped source delivery omits binary resources and is not independently browser-runnable. Apply its changes to the complete checkout rather than deleting your existing assets.

The command does not install dependencies, build/stamp/clean release output, deploy, call GitHub Actions, or alter repository files. Evidence must be outside **every** game/engine checkout, including their `dist` directories. Vite's disposable dev compilation is used, not the release artifact. The source, installed engine bytes and retained `dist` are inventoried before/after a campaign.

## Commands

Run from this repository's root after normal dependency installation:

```powershell
npm run test:persistence-fuzz
npm run verify:persistence-fuzz
npm run verify:persistence-fuzz:browsers
npm run fuzz:persistence:soak -- --hours=10 --seed=0x20261004 --artifacts=C:\js-projects\qualification-evidence\stickvania-js-night-01
```

Use a **new** evidence directory for every command. For many fixed trials instead of a duration:

```powershell
npm run fuzz:persistence:soak -- --trials=10000 --seed=12345 --artifacts=C:\js-projects\qualification-evidence\stickvania-js-trials-01
```

Replay the exact failure recipe:

```powershell
npm run fuzz:persistence:replay -- --replay=C:\path\to\issues\ISSUE_ID\repro.json
```

After making a repair, use the explicit `--allow-source-drift` replay option. It records the new source identity; a clean replay is evidence about that case, not qualification of the changed build. Generator/profile/recipe mismatches are not silently migrated. Replaying `pending-trial.json` from an interrupted run is also supported when it contains a running reproduction.

Bounded minimization is optional and runs only when requested:

```powershell
npm run fuzz:persistence:replay -- --replay=C:\path\to\repro.json --shrink --max-shrink-attempts=32
```

This first reproduces the target signature, then reduces input blocks while keeping the spatial recipe intact. The original remains untouched. Interrupted progress, the reduced recipe and the attempt count are saved separately. Automatic shrinking does not delay ordinary overnight discovery.

`node scripts/run-persistence-fuzz.mjs --help` describes budgets, browser selection, timeout, audio mode and callback counts. `--ticks` means **outer update callbacks**, not an invented count of fixed simulation ticks. The actual game handles its own fixed-step loop.

## Profiles and outcomes

Qualification uses fixed seed `0x20261004`, 24 stage/difficulty ? entry cases plus 22 checkpointless-region cases, 240 outer callbacks per trial and 24 continuation callbacks. Browser qualification uses 120 callbacks and a real document-reload check for every case. Each stratum has separate spatial and natural entries. The resolved version-2 plan is persisted before execution. Soak defaults to eight hours; it first completes the same fixed plan, then alternates new entries and bounded accepted-corpus branches. Work budgets are explicit counts, not wall-time promises.

Both profiles collect failures, retain evidence, retire damaged/stuck trials, and continue. Finding one defect does not stop the campaign. A repeated systemic infrastructure failure, evidence-budget exhaustion, or user interruption ends the run as **incomplete**, not passing. A hard per-trial child-process watchdog terminates only owned workers/browser descendants. First Ctrl+C requests orderly termination and preserves the pending reproduction; killing the outer process forcibly may leave the last pending trial as the recovery record.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Finalized complete run, no findings, every required case and semantic fixture exercised |
| 1    | Findings recorded; release gate fails after collecting the campaign                     |
| 2    | Infrastructure failure, missing coverage, integrity change or incomplete evidence       |
| 130  | User interruption; not qualification                                                    |

A successful local replay does not require sampling every level. A qualification run does. The surrounding npm chain can stop after a failed fuzz campaign; unexecuted later gates are not passes.

## What the adapter exercises

All six stages in normal/hard mode. Spatial trials choose actual stage/segment/region ownership using real checkpoints or stairs, then place Simon in a non-solid footprint with a coherent airborne baseline. Checkpointless regions are not given invented checkpoints.

The adapters initialize real runtime classes and resources, feed normal DOM keyboard events through production input, run production container/Main updates and render schedules, capture actual serializers, and invoke the production frozen-save/store path. Placement is never accepted or rejected by asking the snapshot validator whether it likes the seed.

Capture/validation is frequent. New observed entity/mode coverage, actual phase/owner/life/score transitions and periodic intervals trigger full authorized saves. The original live runtime supplies the uninterrupted continuation. Fresh documents reset static caches before restoring saved bytes and comparing immediate durable state plus continuation. Sampled observation controls restore the same baseline twice: one branch performs frequent captures and real full saves; the other has minimal observation and no intermediate saves. Both reset physical input identically. Compare final durable state and production input-read/update effects, including nondurable lost input. The original-live versus cold-restored continuation remains independent.

The real `pagehide` tier uses the fixture's production frozen-save/store path and receipt, followed by a new document. **It is not a substitute for the full production shell's existing `verify:departure-save` suite**; that suite remains mandatory. Service workers are blocked in fuzz contexts, so service-worker behavior is covered by existing production/offline qualification, not this fixture.

## Deterministic and native audio

The default controlled lane substitutes only browser output nodes and their clock, while retaining production logical audio objects and real OfflineAudioContext decoding. It does not test native device output. An optional `--audio=native` lane is observational: native playback cursor positions are excluded from its strict oracle; transport, ownership and voice membership are still compared. Native timing failures need environment-aware triage. Existing native-audio qualification remains required.

Only wire metadata (`savedAt`, `appVersion`, reconstructed `nextFrameTime`) and JSON's representation of negative zero are normalized. Controlled audio offsets have a narrowly bounded floating-point tolerance. Gameplay counters, state, IDs, ordering, owners and RNG are not broadly ignored.

## Evidence and replay

`campaign.json` records source/engine identities, configuration and the full case plan. `summary.json` remains `status: running, exitCode: null` until the CLI completes integrity and evidence checks. Only a matching version-2 `terminal.json`, with its summary SHA-256, is a terminal receipt. An absent receipt is incomplete; never infer success from an older summary. A separate 16 KiB terminal allowance remains available if normal evidence fills. Count and duration stopping policies are distinct; duration completes only between bounded trials.

Each case records setup, requested/executed callbacks, actual player/actor updates, delivered input actions, captures, verified writes, cold restores, compared continuation steps and missing work. One inert case cannot borrow another case's totals. Presence, active-root membership, actual `update` calls and successful round trips have different marker prefixes. Animation, render and audio progress alone do not establish gameplay progress.

Workers drain new findings and metric deltas after batches of eight callbacks, before navigation and on cooperative cancellation. Run/trial/document/sequence identities deduplicate streamed and terminal delivery. The parent acknowledges flushed evidence, including the last useful checkpoint, before a worker proceeds. Hard hangs retain the last acknowledged boundary; no claim is made about an untransferred synchronous tail. Setup findings remain labelled setup.

Typed signatures retain owner/field/phase while ignoring transient object indexes. Unstructured exceptions retain normalized message and throw location. Uncertain boolean-gate groups preserve up to four full representative variants and report omitted specimens explicitly. Raw occurrence counts and unique manifestations are separate. The default main evidence ceiling is 128 MiB with 256 reporter signatures; evidence exhaustion is incomplete. No unrelated later finding erases earlier discoveries.

There is no automatic GitHub issue creation and no production leaderboard traffic. Each trial uses an isolated browser context and loopback origin; outbound and API writes are denied. Game-over/ending submission attempts cannot reach the production server.

Checkpoints bind exact saved bytes to a SHA-256, current captured stage/world/mode/region context, immutable seed origin and source/resource identities. Corpus branches restore from current context and are labelled `accepted-corpus-branch`; they never earn natural-entry coverage. Old fixture/profile versions are rejected. Ordinary replay reports the requested target separately as reproduced, not observed or inconclusive, and lists unrelated findings separately.

Required semantic boundaries reuse executed producer/browser suites through `semantic-run.mjs`. Successful exact-source/engine receipts live outside the checkout under `qualification-evidence/persistence-semantic-floor`. Qualification and soak require all groups in `semantic-floor.mjs`; absent or stale receipts are incomplete. Run normal qualification before starting an overnight campaign on a new source identity. Receipts distinguish focused producer tests with inert dependencies from real-resource browser and packaged-shell suites; their case assertions, rather than a script's existence, establish coverage. Replay is intentionally limited to its recorded case.

## Qualification and release exclusion

`qualify` includes the short campaign and producer regressions. `qualify:browsers` includes the smaller reload-oriented profile. Neither invokes the overnight profile. Complete source changes and formatting first, commit the intended clean source, then run both gates. Preserve the final qualified `dist`; the standalone fuzz commands must not rebuild it.

A build-only Vite guard rejects fuzz module/string markers in emitted output. The fixture plugin itself is imported only by the test worker, not the normal dev/release configuration. A negative-control test injects a marker and verifies rejection. Full release/archive exclusion must still pass on complete resources.

## Policy inventory

```powershell
npm run generate:persistence-policy-inventory
npm run check:persistence-policy-inventory
```

The committed inventory enumerates saved owner fields, explicit descriptors, declarations, direct producer/consumer references and special encoded shapes. New registry fields change the inventory and fail its check. It is a navigation/coverage tool, **not a proof of all reachable states**: dynamic aliases, resource topology and cross-field rules require source review and real producer trajectories. See `scripts/persistence-fuzz/policy-contracts.md`.

## Rejected production saves

The production diagnostic slot is updated only for an authorized captured outgoing snapshot that a validator rejects or whose validation throws. It is not a trace of normal saves and is not written on load, not-ready, capture, encoding, size, permission or storage failures. It is bounded, best-effort and never replaces the canonical save. A later successful save does not erase forensic evidence.

The soak retains at most 32 accepted, novel checkpoints within an 8 MiB corpus.
Only trials with successful writes, cold restoration and matching continuation
can contribute. Later trials branch from that corpus in fresh documents with new
input/schedule streams. Each reproduction embeds its selected checkpoint and
parent identity; the resolved plan is recorded before execution. Rejected trials
never become branch roots. The corpus is bounded exploration, not exhaustive
actor or phase coverage.

Qualification also runs `npm run verify:persistence-fuzz:controls`: independent
real-resource browser mutations must expose rejected valid snapshots, suppressed
canonical writes, restored-score drift, missing coverage, disabled gameplay updates, dropped input, and saves that consume input, advance RNG or defer a gameplay mutation. Every independent control is attempted; infrastructure errors are not mutation kills. Infrastructure
failures cannot count as mutation kills. Campaign summaries include observed
progress, actual browser version, save timing and maximum captured text size.
Timing uses the browser monotonic clock independently of controlled game clocks.

The save benchmark compares substitution of only the extra loaded-resource
preflight within the current validator stack. It is not a comparison against an
entire older release. No test instrumentation is imported by production entry
points. Controlled audio does not model arbitrary native suspension clocks.

The loaded topology census records every region, checkpoint, entry direction,
stair connection and door. The old selector excludes only stage 0/segment 0/region
4 and stage 2/segment 0/region 1: zero-width terminal partitions behind inactive
doors, with no valid Simon footprint. They remain explicit census exclusions.
Every nonempty checkpointless region has its own required normal/hard case.
Routes track the retained region index of every segment, execute actual checkpoint
and stair producers, then verify active geometry/platform/player roots. Collision
sampling includes both footprint edges. No fabricated checkpoint or validator
filter chooses a placement. Existing presentation/departure suites cover actual
door/stair transitions, and pit/castle suites retain the difficult owner boundaries.

Each adapter owns `transitions.mjs`, which projects its real mode/player/root and audio schema. Ordinary countdowns and audio cursors are excluded; completion, transport, voice membership and stage/region ownership trigger full writes.

Input generator 3 excludes both `P` and NES Start/Enter from random gameplay recipes: either can toggle Pause. Explicit paired pause fixtures retain pause/resume coverage. Recipe/profile format remains 2.
