# Releasing

This file contains the reproducible repository-local release procedure. Detailed maintainer rollout matrices, historical browser caveats, and cross-project deployment notes are intentionally kept outside the public source tree.

## Prerequisites

Use a Node.js version supported by [package.json](package.json), Git, and JDK 21 for the Java desktop build. Install dependencies from the lockfile:

```sh
npm ci
```

Release from one reviewed commit with a clean working tree. Local qualification is the primary gate; GitHub Actions is optional and is not required for release.

## Qualify the exact commit

From the repository root:

```sh
git status --short
npm run qualify
```

`npm run qualify` runs the source checks, dependency audit, production build, Chromium/browser verification, and clean-tree checks defined by the repository scripts. It produces the complete release distribution in `dist/`.

For browser-facing changes, also run the extended browser qualification against the built PWA:

```sh
npm run qualify:browsers
```

Install the Playwright browser engines and platform dependencies required by that command. Automated browser checks do not replace appropriate real-device acceptance for material PWA, audio, input, lifecycle, controller-rumble, fullscreen, or offline changes.

## Inspect and preview

Confirm the working tree is still clean and inspect the generated distribution:

```sh
git status --short
npm run preview:dist
```

Before production deployment, stage the exact qualified `dist/` bytes and perform a focused smoke test of the affected browser and Java desktop behavior. Do not rebuild after stage acceptance and substitute different bytes for deployment.

## Archive

Archive an already-qualified distribution outside the repository:

```sh
node scripts/archive-release.mjs dist /absolute/path/outside/repository/release-artifacts
```

Use a new output directory for each archive. Preserve and verify the generated release metadata/checksums after transfer. Keep the previous known-good archive available for rollback.

## Tag

After qualification and acceptance, create an annotated tag on the exact qualified commit. Use a new version tag and never move an existing release tag. Record the source commit, exact `slick2d-ts` dependency commit, archive/checksum information, and deployment time together.

Creating a build, archive, or tag does not deploy it.
