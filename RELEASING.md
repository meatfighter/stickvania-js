# Release qualification and retention

Release from a clean checkout of one reviewed commit. Preserve existing Git history.
Run `npm run qualify` against that exact commit before pushing or tagging it. Local
qualification is the normal gate; GitHub Actions Verify is manual-only and optional
as a second Linux environment.

Archive an already verified build on a host with Node.js, Git, and tar:

```sh
node scripts/archive-release.mjs dist /absolute/path/outside/repository/release-artifacts
```

Use a new empty output directory for each archive. The command refuses a dirty
checkout or an existing same-commit archive. Verify `SHA256SUMS` after transferring
an archive, and verify the contained files against `RELEASE.json` after extracting.
Rebuilds can have new timestamps: the archive hash identifies the exact deployed
bytes, while the commit identifies their source. Retain the last known good archive
for rollback instead of rebuilding it during an incident.

A manually run Verify workflow provides an independent Linux check and retains its
qualified artifact for 90 days. It is optional and does not replace local qualification.

After all required checks pass, create an annotated release tag on that exact
commit and push the tag. Choose a unique version tag matching the release; never
move an existing tag. Record the tag, commit, archive hash, qualification run, and
actual deployment time together. Creating an archive or tag does not deploy it.
Do not change repository visibility as part of the build.

## Browser qualification

`npm run qualify` includes the production build plus real Chromium and offline PWA
verification. `npm run qualify:browsers` is an optional additional Chromium,
Firefox, and WebKit pass against the built `dist/pwa/`. It checks resource preparation,
game entry, real-tab save takeover, two service-worker cache generations, offline
Continue, and preservation of a newer public save. WebKit's cache fallback is tested
by dropping all connections to the origin; Playwright's offline emulation has a known
WebKit service-worker navigation limitation. Chromium and Firefox also use browser
offline emulation. The cache-generation fixture uses the same candidate's assets with
two worker identities; it does not claim compatibility between arbitrary historical
releases. Existing browser fixtures exercise real Main save/restore, and Stickvania
also compares resumed simulation with uninterrupted simulation in an active stage.

Before the first deployment, record a short real-device pass on supported Safari/iOS
and Android devices: launch from the home screen, enter gameplay, exercise audio and
controls, background/foreground, save/Continue, and cold offline launch. Automated
WebKit is useful coverage but is not a real iOS device qualification. Record failures
and supported browser versions rather than claiming untested support.

On a real phone with a short auto-lock interval, confirm that user-initiated loading
and the launched game keep the screen awake without screen input, including title or
attract behavior and in-game Pause where applicable. Confirm browser/PWA menus allow
normal auto-lock and that backgrounding releases the lock; returning to the game should
reacquire it. Screen wake lock is best-effort, so record an OS/browser refusal under
power-saving conditions rather than treating it as a game failure.

Use a separate browser profile for staging PWA installation and update tests. Staging
and production intentionally resolve to the same manifest app identity for Stickvania,
so installing or updating the staged app in the same profile as production can replace
installed-app metadata even though game saves and preferences remain scoped to the
deployment path.

Before the first public release, install the staged Ms. Pac-Man 2010, Stickvania, and
Jackal PWAs together in one clean profile. Confirm that all three appear as distinct
installed apps, launch and relaunch independently, and that uninstalling one leaves
the other two intact. Close all older app tabs and windows before the final offline
and update pass so a waiting service worker can activate.

Before a later release, keep the currently deployed build open with a real save,
serve the new build at the same deployment path, reload and Continue, then go offline
and Continue again. Test rollback against the same save. Never raise
`FIRST_PUBLIC_GAME_STATE_VERSION` to make an old client delete an unfamiliar save;
New Game and Reset are the explicit destructive paths. Close pre-ownership legacy
tabs during the first rollout, because an already-loaded older client cannot follow
the new single-session protocol.
