# Third-Party Notices

This project depends on slick2d-ts for the browser runtime. slick2d-ts is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License and includes attribution for selected Slick2D API behavior.

Desktop Java runtime dependencies are documented separately in `desktop/RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `desktop/licenses/`, and `desktop/third-party-sources/`. The downloadable desktop package bundles legacy jars, native libraries, license texts, and corresponding-source artifacts; keep this notice file with that package.

## Bundled Desktop Runtime Components

The Java desktop distribution bundles a legacy Slick2D/LWJGL runtime stack so the game can run without a separate runtime setup.
